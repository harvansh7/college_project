					<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to
						conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the
						qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions
						eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point,
						or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as
						equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly
						round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

					<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used
						for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science.
						The early warnings about technological dangers also come from
						science.</p>

					<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not
						that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

					<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl
						who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her
						violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time.
						I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

					<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the
						hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most
						certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in
						our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

					<h2 >The Final Frontier</h2>

					<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the
						stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy
						the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there
						is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

					<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the
						stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy
						the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there
						is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

					<blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of
						today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered
						prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too
						little for the next ten.</blockquote>

					<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any
						one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which
						mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of
						human development.</p>

					<h2 >Reaching for the Stars</h2>

					<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth]
						diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the
						most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living
						object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with
						a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to
						change a man.</p>

					
					 <span >To go places and do things
						that have never been done before – that’s what living is all
						about.</span>

					<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the
						Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new
						worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go
						where no man has gone before.</p>

					<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley,
						I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man
						must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
